A 40 Meter Magnetic Loop With Semi-Automatic tuning by WA2FZW
Version 1.2

This project describes the construction of a homebrew 2-turn 40 meter
magnetic loop antenna and the semi-automatic remote tuner for it.

The tuner uses an Arduino Uno with a stepper motor driver shield to
tune the antenna remotely. Presently, the controller requires a hand-
wired board, bit sometime in the future I will get around to designing
a proper PCB.
